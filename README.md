### Overview

Jest is a powerful, flexible testing framework, and Enzyme provides tools to test React and Redux applications. In this course, you will learn to test:

* Connected and unconnected components
* Component state and Redux state
* Action creators and reducers
* Complex action creators that use Redux Thunk and Axios
* Action creators called from connected components

Each sub-directory is a separate *`create-react-app`* project. 

### Getting Started 
1. Navigate to each sub-directory (e.g. Jotto App, Click Counter, etc.) 
2. If this is your first time, run `npm install` 
3. To start the server in each, run `npm start` 
4. To have the tests running live and to monitor them, run `npm test`
